							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was my second EP I recorded, which is the first one I really "tried" on. 
							This is another one I'm not fond of, so it is no longer available. To be fair, I still barely knew how to
							play guitar, and most people don't try to record a collection of original songs before learning how to play
							stuff (for good reason), but alas, they exist, and here they are. I started recording these before
							going on to college, and tried to go on a binge of writing a few new songs every weekend, and came up with 
							a lot of material. I originally wanted this to be an album, but decided an EP was more digestable for a first
							release, so I cut a lot of songs (but included a few of them as bonus tracks on the CD anyway). Tracks 5 and 6
							are from my previous EP, and track 13 is a B-side from the previous EP. All songs were written, recorded, and
							produced by Patrick Nelson.
